//! Actuator controls. Normed to -1..+1 where 0 is neutral position. Throttle for single rotation direction motors is 0..1, negative range for reverse direction. Standard mapping for attitude controls (group 0): (index 0-7): roll, pitch, yaw, throttle, flaps, spoilers, airbrakes, landing gear. Load a pass-through mixer to repurpose them as generic outputs.
